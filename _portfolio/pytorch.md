[Pytorch2](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch) is a ML compiler framework for dynamic deep learning workloads. It features Dynamo and Inductor as the compiler frontend and backend to optimize deep learning codes. I have contributed to both components during my PhD study, which deepens my understanding of ML compiler stack.
